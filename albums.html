                    <h5>Artist bio</h5>
                    <p>Janelle Monae is many people in alternate timelines at once. She's an archivist of right now, interpreter of back then, dreamer of one day. She imagines black people into the future in the midst of past and present threats of erasure. And after two studio EPs and three albums, the full scope of her work illuminates how the past, present and future might exist simultaneously. Who we were, who we are and who we'd like to be swirl and layer until timelines merge.</p>

                    <h5>Album review</h5>
                    <p>The Kansas City native has always had a knack for finding complementary collaborators, including Erykah Badu, Solange, and Miguel, as well as a desire to establish a creative arena in which to play with them (to wit: her label, Wondaland Records). For Dirty Computer, an eclectic and titillating collection of future-pop, trap-driven, and R&B-infused songs, Monae's tapped prodigious producers like Pharrell Williams, fellow feminist performers like Grimes and Zoe Kravitz, and music legends like Brian Wilson and Stevie Wonder to help broadcast her story. But the album's most prominent influence--aside from black girl magic--is the late Prince, who was a mentor and collaborator to Mon√°e. His death in 2016 obviously prevented him from making extensive contributions, but the Purple One did provide the synth line that gets under your skin in "Make Me Feel." And the joy he took from connection, creation, and flouting conventions can be found in nearly a third of Dirty Computer's tracks, including "Crazy, Classic, Life," "Americans," and the "1999"-inspired "Screwed."</p>

                    <h4 class="artist-name">Houndmouth</h4>
                    <h5>Artist bio</h5>
                    <p>There are four official members of Houndmouth: guitarist Matt Myers, keyboardist Katie Toupin, drummer Shane Cody and bassist Zak Appleby, all of whom also pitch in with the singing and songwriting. But far more people than that contribute to their second album, Little Neon Limelight. Only artful alt-roots producer Dave Cobb, recording engineer Vance Powell and mastering engineer Pete Lyman pop up in the credits, though. The rest shuffle in and out of view over the course of 11 songs, occasionally clumping into motley crowds, like "the notables and their spying wives, three hipsters, two merchants, and Kon Tiki" in the second verse of the wistful folk tune "For No One."</p>

                    <h5>Album review</h5>
                    <p>Little Neon Limelight is a raucous joyride through deep swells of Americana, folk and country, driven by hootenanny stomp-and-holler gang vocals and old-fashioned honky-tonk vibrations filtered through Houndmouth's youthful exuberance.</p>
                    <p>The Indiana band sounds best when every voice is working overtime, combining ramshackle belted-out harmonies with skewed down-home country on heavy southern soul tunes like Otis and By God. Black Gold combines the band's explosive dynamic, switching quick between funky verses and blowout choruses. The quiet anger of For No One and Katie Toupin's lonesome wail on Gasoline prove they can mellow things out, but the former is a bit sparse in the company of so many high-energy numbers. A touch of kitsch creeps into Say It, but they get back on track with sweetly heartfelt closer Darlin'. </p>
